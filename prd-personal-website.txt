1. Introduction / Overview

This project aims to build a personal website for Pankaj Kumar Sinha — a creative technologist, optimization researcher, and system architect. The site will serve as a public-facing professional and personal identity, blending his deep academic work with his emerging ventures and philosophical writing.

The goal is to create a space that feels intellectually rigorous, technically modern, and spiritually grounded, where visitors can learn about his research, ventures, and ideas through an elegant, interactive interface hosted on GitHub Pages.

2. Goals

Present a cohesive professional identity blending academia, entrepreneurship, and thought leadership.

Provide a structured yet expressive medium for publishing writings, reflections, and research notes.

Showcase ventures and projects (e.g., Riti, CityConnect, iLag, etc.) as living examples of applied intelligence.

Build an interactive site that can evolve — adding features like a blog CMS, comment system, or AI assistant later.

Host the site on GitHub Pages for easy maintenance and free deployment.

3. User Stories

As a visitor, I can read about Pankaj’s background and research focus.

As a fellow academic or collaborator, I can browse his current projects and publications.

As an entrepreneur or investor, I can understand his ventures, their goals, and philosophies.

As a reader or thinker, I can explore his writings and reflections.

As Pankaj (admin), I can add or edit content (blogs, project summaries, or links) easily without major technical overhead.

4. Functional Requirements

The site must include the following sections/pages:

Home: A concise personal introduction and visual overview of Pankaj’s intellectual ecosystem.

Research: Summaries of key research papers, topics, and academic interests.

Writing: A blog-like section featuring categorized essays, reflections, or philosophical notes.

Ventures: Overview of projects such as Riti, CityConnect, iLag, etc.

Contact: Email or form-based contact section (with basic anti-spam).

The site should include global navigation linking all major sections.

The website should be built using a modern static site framework (React, Astro, or Next.js recommended for interactivity).

Content for writing/blog should be Markdown-based for easy editing and Git-based publishing.

Include a light/dark mode toggle to suit different viewing preferences.

Include SEO metadata and Open Graph previews for social media sharing.

The site must be easily deployable via GitHub Pages workflow.

The design should balance creative tech-founder energy (sharp typography, modern layout) with spiritual calmness (warm tones, whitespace, subtle motion).

5. Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

No need for user authentication or comments initially.

No need for a complex CMS backend at this stage (content in Markdown).

No e-commerce or donation functionality in the first version.

No AI chat integration in the initial release (reserved for future).

6. Design Considerations

Visuals: Blend modern minimalism with symbolic depth — possible use of soft gradients, geometric patterns, or subtle animated elements.

Typography: Professional serif + modern sans-serif pairing.

Responsive Design: Must look great on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Imagery: Optionally include background visuals from nature, code, or abstract art — representing synthesis of logic and consciousness.

7. Technical Considerations

Framework: Recommend Next.js + TailwindCSS for scalability and styling control.

Deployment: GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

Blog system: Markdown or MDX files parsed at build time.

Future extensions: Contact form via Formspree or EmailJS; AI Assistant via OpenAI API.

8. Success Metrics

The site deploys successfully and loads within 2 seconds.

Visitors can easily navigate between all sections.

Blog posts render correctly in Markdown.

Visual feedback from peers indicates professional yet soulful aesthetic.

Easy to update content without breaking structure.
