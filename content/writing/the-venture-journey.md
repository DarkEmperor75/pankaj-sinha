# The Venture Journey: From Idea to Impact

Building a venture is fundamentally an optimization problem. You're trying to maximize impact—whether measured in users served, problems solved, or value created—while navigating constraints of resources, time, and market dynamics.

## Starting with Research

Many of the most impactful ventures begin not with a business plan, but with a research question. What happens when you apply rigorous thinking to a real-world problem? Often, the answer reveals opportunities that traditional business thinking might miss.

## The Bridge Between Worlds

Academic research and entrepreneurship are often seen as separate domains. But in practice, they're deeply interconnected. Research provides the foundation of understanding; entrepreneurship provides the mechanism for impact at scale.

## Lessons from the Field

Through ventures like Riti, CityConnect, and iLag, I've learned that the most successful projects are those that maintain their connection to fundamental questions while remaining responsive to practical needs.
